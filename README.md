# BMI-Calculator

This is done as an in-class assignment. This BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator was created in Android Studio using Kotlin. This project is to learn to start a new android studio project, define an XML layout, and connect the view to kotlin code using modern techniques ie View binding.
